<h3>Description</h3>
<em>What isn't pesto good in? It's a sauce that turns any dish into kitchen gold, especially this totally comforting and delicious gnocchi and chicken bake. For the perfect pesto touch, stir a dollop into the tomato mixture to coat everything, then dollop the top with more right out of the oven for a fresh finish. Whether you use our go-to pesto recipe to get started or buy your favourite store-bought version to speed things up, this dish isn't going to last long—it's the kind of meal people will fight over the last spoonful.</em>

<!-- method -->
<h3>Method</h3>
<h5>Step 1</h5>
<p>
    Preheat oven to 220°C. Season chicken on both sides with 3.5 ml of salt and 1.5 ml of pepper. In a large straight-sided skillet over medium-high heat, heat 15 ml oil. Add chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 4' to 6' per side. Transfer to a plate.
</p>
<h5>Step 2</h5>
<p>
    In same skillet over medium heat, heat remaining 15 ml oil. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3' to 5'. Add tomatoes and wine and cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits on bottom of pan, until wine is mostly evaporated and tomatoes are just starting to wilt, about 2'. Pour in stock and cream and bring to a boil. Stir in gnocchi and nestle chicken back into pan.
</p>
<h5>Step 3</h5>
<p>
    Bake in oven until chicken is cooked through, 8' to 10'. Transfer chicken to a cutting board.
</p>
<h5>Step 4</h5>
<p>
    Stir 30 ml pesto into skillet. Top with mozzarella (if using). Continue to bake until pesto is warmed through and cheese is melted, about 4' more. Let cool slightly.
</p>
<h5>Step 5</h5>
<p>
    Thinly slice chicken and return to skillet. Dollop top of bake with remaining 90 ml pesto. Sprinkle with basil and pine nuts. Serve.
